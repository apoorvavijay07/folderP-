This folder contains Python programs designed for learning and practice. You'll find files like code.py, code1.py, and so on, which aim to clearly explain Python fundamentals â€“ hopefully helpful for those just starting out. 
The other sets of programs here will help you understand and practice specific Python concepts (just a heads-up, not every concept is covered in this collection).
